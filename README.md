## Real actual?
This really has become my hacking tree, used for developing laks support for these parts.
I have a "real" miniblink repo planned that will now be elsewhere...

## Karl's riscv miniblinks...

goal targets, in this repo or another...
* gd32vf103 (readily available easy to verify my tools)
* ch582/ch583 (hoho completely different)

## Status
* ch582: blink works, uart works, with interrupts, ADC temp sensor
* ch32v307: blink works, uart works, with interrupts
* gd32vf103: blink works, but at a fixed speed? something else is weird?
